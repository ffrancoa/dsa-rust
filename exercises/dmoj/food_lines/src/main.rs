// Food Lines
//
// After many years of continuous warfare, the country of Collea was left in shambles.
// This has caused food shortages and famines all across the country. In an attempt to
// distribute the little food that was produced and prevent food hoarding, the Collean
// government limited the amount of food that any one person can buy. Soon, Collean
// citizens are forced to wait in long lines in order to obtain the food they needed.
// There are currently `N` such food lines in the city of Lachtin, the `i`th of which
// has `a_i` people in it. `M` people are going to enter one of the lines in the next
// hour, where they each enter the shortest line they see. Since Phreia plans to enter
// the line, she wants to know the length of the line that each person decides to join.
//
// Constraints
// -----------
// 1 <= `N` <= 100
// 1 <= `a_i` <= 100 for `i` in 1, 2, …, `N`
// 1 <= `M` <= 100
//
// Input Specification
// -------------------
// The first line contains two positive integers, `N` and `M`.
// The second line contains `N` positive integers, `a_1`, `a_2`, …, `a_N`.
//
// Output Specification
// --------------------
// Print `M` lines, the `i`th of which being the length of the line that the `i`th
// person joined.
